# CPPDubovSystem Tests

In this folder are a series of TRF files. Each "test tournament" contains pairings generated with the Dubov pairing system, and all these pairings are known to be accurate.

Each TRF here was tested with the free pairings checker CPPDubovSystem comes with, to make sure the output is correct. A few TRF files (marked with the name "random") are tournaments generated under the random tournament generator this framework comes with.
